# Active Platform Goal Progress

This file tracks the active long-running platform goal and the concrete slices
completed toward it. Keep it updated as the goal evolves.

## Current Goal

Build a complete AppGen IDE and generation platform with:

- Full component parity for classic desktop and cross-platform visual controls.
- Native Pascal compiler/runtime contracts and form design-time streaming.
- Full Object Inspector coverage for property editors, event editors,
  component editors, and custom designers.
- Visual data-binding designer depth.
- Native IDE tooling for data access, service publishing, embedded database
  workflows, and failover/replay paths.
- Design-time package and component installation ecosystem.
- Full mobile/native device API component coverage.
- Animation, styling, effects, and 3D design-surface depth.

## Progress Ledger

| Date | Commit | Slice | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-05-23 | `35387ed` | Polished IDE palette and component icons. | Frontend production build, staged diff checks. |
| 2026-05-23 | `291c458` | Added first-class inspector editor lanes. | Frontend production build, catalog audit integration. |
| 2026-05-23 | `50c5fd7` | Added visual data-binding lane and binding audit. | Frontend production build, dev shell probe. |
| 2026-05-23 | `89641d5` | Added design-time package manager and package audit. | Frontend production build, dev shell probe. |
| 2026-05-23 | `3f7997c` | Standard action registry and guarded handler invocation. | Py compile, focused tests, and full Python suite passed. |

## Current Working Slice

Standardize button and component handler architecture by adding:

- Shared action registry contracts.
- Explicit handler signature and context API.
- Guarded cross-handler invocation policy.
- Safe component-handler invocation operation.
- Generated parity and tests.

## Open Completion Areas

- Broaden frontend IDE interaction tests beyond build-level verification.
- Continue mobile/native device API coverage in the visible IDE.
- Deepen data access and service-publishing tooling in the IDE.
- Expand runtime/compiler proof from metadata contracts toward executable
  integration where available.
- Continue package lifecycle depth beyond catalog and UI into install/update
  execution and signature validation.
