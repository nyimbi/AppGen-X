# Active Platform Goal Progress

This file tracks the active long-running platform goal and the concrete slices
completed toward it. Keep it updated as the goal evolves.

## Current Goal

Build a complete AppGen IDE and generation platform with:

- Full component parity for classic desktop and cross-platform visual controls.
- Native Pascal compiler/runtime contracts and form design-time streaming.
- Full Object Inspector coverage for property editors, event editors,
  component editors, and custom designers.
- Visual data-binding designer depth.
- Native IDE tooling for data access, service publishing, embedded database
  workflows, and failover/replay paths.
- Design-time package and component installation ecosystem.
- Full mobile/native device API component coverage.
- Animation, styling, effects, and 3D design-surface depth.

## Current Working Slice

Expand runtime/compiler proof from metadata contracts toward executable
integration by adding:

- Generated runtime contract tests for form/component metadata.
- DSL-to-runtime smoke fixtures for representative applications.
- Compiler/runtime capability matrix checks.
- Packaging proof hooks for web, mobile, and desktop outputs.

## Open Completion Areas

- Broaden frontend IDE interaction tests beyond build-level verification.
- Expand runtime/compiler proof from metadata contracts toward executable
  integration where available.
- Continue package lifecycle depth beyond catalog and UI into install/update
  execution and signature validation.
