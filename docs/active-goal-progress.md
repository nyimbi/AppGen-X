# Active Platform Goal Progress

This file tracks the active long-running platform goal and the concrete slices
completed toward it. Keep it updated as the goal evolves.

## Current Goal

Build a complete AppGen IDE and generation platform with:

- Full component parity for classic desktop and cross-platform visual controls.
- Native Pascal compiler/runtime contracts and form design-time streaming.
- Full Object Inspector coverage for property editors, event editors,
  component editors, and custom designers.
- Visual data-binding designer depth.
- Native IDE tooling for data access, service publishing, embedded database
  workflows, and failover/replay paths.
- Design-time package and component installation ecosystem.
- Full mobile/native device API component coverage.
- Animation, styling, effects, and 3D design-surface depth.

## Current Working Slice

Extend generated target outputs beyond starter packages by adding:

- Browser-level Studio interaction tests.
- Installable desktop packaging proof.
- Mobile packaging proof beyond starter metadata.
- Runtime smoke checks for generated target apps.

## Open Completion Areas

- Extend package lifecycle proof to real binary adapters when available.
- Broaden frontend IDE interaction proof with browser-level rendering checks.
